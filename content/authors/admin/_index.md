I am a second-year Ph.D. candidate at EPFL, where I am advised by [Pascal Frossard](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lts4/people/people-current/frossard/).
I am currently working on generative models for graphs, with a strong passion for their potential in drug discovery to advance scientific research.
Beyond that, my interests span enhancing control over generative models, graph machine learning, and neural network explainability.

Before starting my PhD, I completed my undergraduate studies in Information Engineering and French at Shanghai Jiao-Tong University (SJTU), within the Paris Élite Institute of Technology (SPEIT). Following this, I was selected for the dual-degree program with École Polytechnique (X), and earned the title of Ingénieur diplômé de l'École polytechnique with a focus on applied mathematics. My studies in France finished with an internship at École Normale Supérieure (ENS), Paris, where I worked on a project titled "Learning Cell Dynamic Features for Unlabeled Video-Microscopies from Synthetic Data" under the supervision [Lisa Bedin](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Lisa_Bedin2) and [Auguste Genovesio](https://scholar.google.fr/citations?user=hE2StEAAAAAJ&hl=en). Subsequently, I completed my master's degree at SJTU under the supervision of [Ya Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pbjw9sMAAAAJ&hl=en), [Jiangchao Yao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w8oDh9QAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Yanfeng Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=x_sgJskAAAAJ&hl=en). 

I'm also passionate about singing! At SJTU, I was part of the a cappella choir in SPEIT, and during my time at École Polytechnique, I played the role of soprano in a Broadway association. Also, I keep painting and I'm also trying to learn guitar.
