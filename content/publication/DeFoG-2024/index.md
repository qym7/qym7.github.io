title: 'DeFoG: Discrete Flow Matching for Graph Generation'
subtitle: ''
summary: 'Graph generation models often face limitations in sampling efficiency and flexibility due to tightly coupled training and sampling stages. We introduce DeFoG, a discrete flow matching framework that disentangles these stages, improving both efficiency and performance over existing diffusion models.'
